            <li>1. Landon: I will work on ensuring that it looks good/proper, the generation of the cards (including randomization), Donovan: Ensuring the quality of what happens when the cards are clicked.(including making them disappear) + heading with pages, Kennon: Making sure that the session storage keeps track of who wins and making the play again win conditions + rules. </li>
            <li>2. Halloween </li>
            <li>3. Group wise, I feel like a problem might be coordinating who will work on what file and when, so another incident doesn't occur</li>
